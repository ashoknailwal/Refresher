# Refresher
A simple multiple tabs refreshing chrome extension

Before installation you have to choose an image for the icon of this extension (in future I will be adding the icon image for the extension)
and save it by the name "icon.png" in the Refresher directory i.e root directory of project

## Installation
* Enable developers mode in chrome (menu->Tools->Extensions and them selecting checkbox 'Enable Developer mode' in upper right corner)
* Click on the "Load unpacked extension" button.
* Select the drefresher's directory

If anyone wants to request additional features then you can write a short description in featuresRequest.md file If any issues is found the report an issue
